# NTXSoccer-iOS
App I am currently creating for the North Texas Soccer Association for iOS.  In addition to having field maps for every complex in North Texas, I implemented navigation functionality, league information, and a built-in calendar for the user. Unfortunately, the app was not approved by the Apple Store, so I am still working an editing it to get approved. Please check the demonstration video below to see how the app works.
